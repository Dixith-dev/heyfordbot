A: Private Dining / Conference Room
Tucked into a scene of its own, our Private Dining Room is the perfect setting for special occasions and corporate meetings. Adorned in an array of glass globe lights and a quirky industrial ceiling, the room screams modern chic with its teal and burnt orange interior, foliage and a terrace overlooking the village green.
Our private dining room has a capacity of 16 seated or 25 for a standing reception. The room has AV equipment including a 65″ smart screen with Microsoft Teams integrated and conference technology. From set menus to canapes, working lunches and breakfast, our team of Chefs have tailored a hearty selection to compliment the cuisine of both Baton & 455 Bar.
